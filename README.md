# Selection sort and Insertion sort
## Aim:
To write a program to perform selection sort and insertion sort using python programming.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Selection Sort Algorithm:
1.	Set the first unsorted element as the minimum
2.	For each of the unsorted elements, check if the element < current minimum.
3.	If yes, set the element as the new minimum.
4.	Swap minimum with first unsorted position.
5.	Repeat the steps 2 and 3 for all the elements in the array.
## Insertion Sort Algorithm:
1.	Set the first element as sorted element j.
2.	For each unsorted element X, check if current sorted element j >X.
3.	If yes, move sorted element to the right by 1.
4.	Break the loop and insert X.
5.	Repeat the steps 2 to 4 for sorting all the elements in the array.
## Program:
### i) Selection Sort
```
''' 
Program to sort the elements in the list using the Selection Sort algorithm.

        nums[j+1]=item_to_insert

## Output:
### i) Selection Sort
![sort the elements in the list using selection sort algorithum](https://github.com/Bhuvanesh-Suresh/Sorting-Algorithm/assets/145742661/7d8f2048-a095-45f7-8885-250b725fee57)

### ii)	Insertion Sort
![sort the elements in the list using the insertion sort algorithm](https://github.com/Bhuvanesh-Suresh/Sorting-Algorithm/assets/145742661/7c7f56ed-a447-48b1-af65-8f17cee4f4df)

## Result:
Thus the program is written to perform selection sort and insertion sort using python programming.
